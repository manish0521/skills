# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a collection of 26 agent skills for Claude Code and agentskills.io-compatible agents. Skills provide specialized domain knowledge and frameworks for specific use cases (UX design, marketing, product strategy, sales, operations, positioning, virality, etc.).

## Skill File Format

Each skill has a `SKILL.md` with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: 'Framework description based on Author''s "Book Title". Use when you need to: (1) first use case, (2) second use case, (3) third use case.'
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: wondelai
  version: "1.0.0"
---

# Skill Title

Intro paragraph about the framework.

## Core Principle

**Bold opening statement.** Foundation paragraph.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** Rate 0-10 based on adherence to the principles below...

## Framework Sections

### 1. First Section

**Core concept:** ...
**Why it works:** ...
**Key insights:** (bullet list)
**Product applications:** (table: Context | Application | Example)
**Copy patterns:** (bullet list with quoted examples)
**Ethical boundary:** ...
See: [references/file.md](references/file.md)

## Common Mistakes

## About the Author
(Author bio)
```

### Required Fields
- `name`: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens for spaces, max 64 chars)
- `description`: What the skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars). Use numbered use cases: `(1) ..., (2) ..., (3) ...`

### Recommended Fields (for marketplace)
- `license`: License name (we use MIT)
- `metadata.author`: Author/organization name (we use `wondelai`)
- `metadata.version`: Semantic version

The YAML frontmatter `description` field is critical for skill discovery - it should include keywords and trigger phrases that help match user requests to the skill. Single quotes in YAML values must be escaped by doubling them (`''`).

## Adding New Skills

1. Create a new folder: `{skill-name}/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and skill instructions
3. Add `references/` folder with supporting `.md` files (each 1500-3000 words)
4. Add the skill to `README.md`:
   - Add to "Via skills.sh" installation list
   - Add row to "Available Skills" table
   - Add "Skill Details" section (description, About the author, Use when, Example prompts)
   - Add to "Copyright & Disclaimer" section
5. Add the skill to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` under the appropriate plugin collection

## Versioning Policy

Skills use semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or complete rewrites
- **MINOR**: New features, significant enhancements, new sections
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, typo corrections, small clarifications

**Auto-increment rule:** When modifying a skill's `SKILL.md` or its `references/` files, always bump the version in the frontmatter:
- Content addition/enhancement → bump MINOR (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`)
- Small fix/typo → bump PATCH (e.g., `1.1.0` → `1.1.1`)

Example:
```yaml
metadata:
  author: wondelai
  version: "1.1.0"
```

## Commit Policy

Commit directly to main.
