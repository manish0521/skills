```
I run a solo habit-tracking app with 500 users.
Day-1 retention is 40%, Day-7 is 12%.

I can't hire engineers, so solutions must be simple
(email, push notifications, UI copy changes).

Diagnose the problem using B=MAP:
- Is my core action too hard (Ability)?
- Poorly timed (Prompt)?
- Not motivating enough (Motivation)?

Design 3 low-effort interventions I can implement with email
automation and a simple UI tweak.

Use improve-retention skill.

### Plan Your Go-to-Market as a Solo Founder

> You're ready to launch but don't know whether to go niche or broad.

**Prompt:**

```
I built a project management tool for architecture firms.
I have $0 marketing budget and no team.

Help me decide: should I target a narrow beachhead segment
(small firms, 5-10 people) and dominate it before expanding,
or go broad?

Map my current product against the "whole product" requirements
for my target segment.

Then apply the ERRC grid to differentiate from Asana
and Monday.com without needing more features.

Use crossing-the-chasm and blue-ocean-strategy skills.
