## Startup Founders

You have an idea, limited runway, and need to move fast. These scenarios walk you from validating a concept through pricing, positioning, and acquiring your first users.

### Discover What Customers Actually Need

> You have a hunch for a B2B product but aren't sure if the pain is real or just your own projection.

**Prompt:**

```
I'm building a tool that helps freelancers track unpaid invoices. Before I write any code, help me uncover the real Job to Be Done. Who are the likely hiring managers, what's the struggling moment that triggers the search for a solution, and what competing "hires" (including non-consumption) should I worry about? Then design a 10-question customer discovery interview guide I can use this week. Use jobs-to-be-done skill.
```

**Skills used:** jobs-to-be-done

---

### Scope an MVP You Can Ship in Two Weeks

> You've validated demand but don't know what to cut to ship fast.

**Prompt:**

```
Here's everything our invoice-tracking tool could do: [paste feature list]. Identify our riskiest assumption and design the smallest possible MVP that tests it. Give me a Build-Measure-Learn experiment card with hypothesis, metric, and success threshold. Then outline a 5-day sprint plan to go from sketches to a testable prototype. Use lean-startup and design-sprint skills.
```

**Skills used:** lean-startup, design-sprint

---

### Set Pricing That Captures Value

> You're guessing at a price point and worried about leaving money on the table.

Using the Value Equation, help me set a price that delivers at least 10:1 perceived value. Then design a Grand Slam Offer with 3 bonuses, a risk-reversing guarantee, and ethical urgency. Use hundred-million-offers skill.
```

**Skills used:** hundred-million-offers

---

### Position Against Spreadsheets and Incumbents

> Prospects keep saying "we just use Excel" or comparing you to a large competitor.

**Prompt:**

```
Our competitive alternatives aren't just other invoice tools — freelancers also use spreadsheets, sticky notes, and "just remembering." Walk me through the Obviously Awesome positioning exercise: list competitive alternatives, identify our unique attributes, map them to value themes, define our best-fit customer segment, and recommend whether we should position in an existing category or create a subcategory. Then write positioning for pragmatist buyers who need proof before switching. Use obviously-awesome and crossing-the-chasm skills.
```

**Skills used:** obviously-awesome, crossing-the-chasm

---

### Find Whitespace in a Crowded Market

**Prompt:**

```
Here's our current 2-minute pitch: [paste draft]. Score it on the SUCCESs checklist (Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories).

Use made-to-stick skill.
```

**Skills used:** made-to-stick

---

### Get Your First 100 Users Organically

> You've launched but have zero marketing budget and need word-of-mouth.

```

**Skills used:** contagious, one-page-marketing

> 60% of signups never complete setup, and you don't know why.

**Prompt:**

```
Here's our 5-step onboarding flow: [describe steps]. Diagnose the drop-off using B=MAP — for each step, assess whether the barrier is motivation (do they want to?), ability (can they do it easily?), or prompt (are we asking at the right moment?).

> A well-funded competitor just launched a similar product and your sales team is panicking.

**Prompt:**

```
A new competitor just raised $20M and launched a product that overlaps with 60% of our features. Help me re-run our positioning: what are the competitive alternatives now, what unique attributes do we still own, and which customer segment values those attributes most? Write a short internal positioning brief the sales team can use on calls starting tomorrow. Use obviously-awesome skill.
```

**Skills used:** obviously-awesome

---

### Design a Daily Habit Loop for a Productivity App

> Users love the product during their first session but don't come back the next day.

**Prompt:**

```
Our task management app has high Day-1 engagement but Day-7 retention is 18%. Design a Hook cycle: what internal trigger should we attach to (emotion/routine), what's the simplest core action, what variable reward keeps it interesting, and what investment makes the product better with use? Then create a Tiny Habits recipe (After I [anchor], I will [tiny behavior]) for our ideal daily action. Use hooked-ux and improve-retention skills.
```

**Skills used:** hooked-ux, improve-retention

---

### Align a Growing Team Around Vision and Priorities

> You've grown from 5 to 25 people and coordination is breaking down.

We're a 25-person SaaS company and teams are drifting. Help me create: (1) a Vision/Traction Organizer with our 10-year target, 3-year picture, and 1-year plan, and (2) a team structure evaluation — are people in the right seats?

Use traction-eos and drive-motivation skills.
```

**Skills used:** traction-eos, drive-motivation

---

### Reduce User Errors in a Complex Workflow

> Users constantly misconfigure a critical settings panel and then blame the product.

**Prompt:**

```
Here's our settings panel: [describe or paste screenshot path]. Users frequently select the wrong options, leading to support tickets. Analyze using Norman's framework: what affordances are misleading, what signifiers are missing, and where is the conceptual model mismatched with the user's mental model? Recommend constraints that make errors impossible rather than just showing error messages. Use design-everyday-things skill.
```

**Skills used:** design-everyday-things

---

### Win Back Churned Users

> You have 3,000 churned users and want to re-engage the salvageable ones.

**Prompt:**

```
We have 3,000 users who churned in the last 90 days. Help me design a win-back campaign: (1) segment churned users by their last completed action to identify who's salvageable, (2) diagnose the likely B=MAP failure for each segment, and (3) design a STEPPS-based re-engagement email that gives them social currency for returning ("You're in the top 10% of power users who..."). Use improve-retention and contagious skills.
```

**Skills used:** improve-retention, contagious

**Prompt:**

```
Here's our landing page: [paste URL or describe layout].

---

### Engineer a Viral Product Launch

> You're launching a new feature and want organic buzz, not just paid ads.

**Prompt:**

### Write a Lead Nurture Email Sequence

> You're capturing emails but have no follow-up system — leads go cold.

**Prompt:**

```
Here's our current pricing page: [describe tiers and pricing]. Audit it twice: (1) using CRO methodology, create an objection/counter-objection table for each tier — what's stopping people from clicking?

Use cro-methodology and hundred-million-offers skills.
```

For one of those channels, design a scorecard lead magnet that qualifies leads automatically. Use one-page-marketing and scorecard-marketing skills.
```

**Skills used:** one-page-marketing, scorecard-marketing

---

### Add Social Proof That Actually Persuades

Use influence-psychology and cro-methodology skills.
```

**Skills used:** influence-psychology, cro-methodology

---

### Overhaul Typography for Readability

```
Here's our current CSS for body text and headings: [paste styles]. Evaluate the typeface choices for screen readability, check line-height, measure, and font-size ratios. Recommend a type scale that creates clear hierarchy. Then apply Refactoring UI's hierarchy principles — are we relying too much on font-size alone instead of weight, color, and spacing? Deliver updated CSS. Use web-typography and refactoring-ui skills.
```

**Skills used:** web-typography, refactoring-ui

```

**Skills used:** hooked-ux, improve-retention

> You're rewriting an entire website and need a messaging foundation first.

**Prompt:**

```
