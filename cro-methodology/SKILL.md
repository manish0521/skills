# CRO Methodology

Scientific, customer-centric approach to conversion rate optimization based on the CRE Methodology™.

## Core Philosophy

**Don't guess—discover.** The methodology rejects "best practices" and "magic buttons" in favor of evidence-based optimization. Extraordinary improvements come from understanding WHY visitors don't convert, not from copying competitors or applying generic tips.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When reviewing or creating landing pages, funnels, or conversion flows, rate them 0-10 based on adherence to the principles below. A 10/10 means full alignment with all guidelines; lower scores indicate gaps to address. Always provide the current score and specific improvements needed to reach 10/10.

## The 9-Step CRE Process

### 1. Define Success Metrics
Align goals with business KPIs. Don't jump to testing—first understand what success looks like. Identify which metrics actually matter (revenue, not just clicks).

### 2. Map the Conversion Funnel
Visualize every step from first impression to thank-you page. Identify:
- **Blocked arteries**: High-traffic paths with underperformance
- **Missing links**: Gaps in the funnel (no referral program, no email sequence, no upsells)

### 3. Understand Visitors (The Critical Step)
Answer: "Why aren't visitors converting?" Research in three areas:

**a) Visitor types & intentions**
- New vs. repeat visitors
- Traffic source behavior
- Buyer journey stage
- Intent signals

**b) UX problems** (willing but unable)
- Browser compatibility
- Page speed
- Navigation clarity
- Form usability
- Error messages

**c) Objections** (able but unwilling)
Use surveys, chat logs, support tickets to capture the "voice of the customer." See [OBJECTIONS.md](references/OBJECTIONS.md) for O/CO framework.

### 4. Gather Market Intelligence
- Analyze competitors
- Monitor social media, reviews
- Transfer winning strategies from other industries
- Identify positioning opportunities

### 5. Find Hidden Persuasion Assets
Every company has overlooked proof elements:
- Testimonials not displayed
- Awards not mentioned
- Statistics not highlighted
- Guarantees not prominent
- Team credentials hidden

Create a "wish list" of assets to acquire.

### 6. Create Experimental Strategy
Prioritize ideas using the ICE framework:
1. **Impact**: Could this double conversion rate? (1-10)
2. **Confidence**: How sure are we this will work? (1-10)
3. **Ease**: How easy to implement? (1-10)

**Critical**: Make BOLD changes, not "meek tweaks." Small changes rarely reach statistical significance and waste resources.

See [testing-methodology.md](references/testing-methodology.md) for detailed ICE scoring and prioritization.

### 7. Design Challengers
Create wireframes based on research insights (not guesswork). Focus on:
- Headlines
- Introductory paragraphs  
- Calls-to-action
- Objection handling

See [COPYWRITING.md](references/COPYWRITING.md) for persuasion techniques.

### 8. Run Experiments
Use A/B testing platforms (Optimizely, VWO, etc.). For each test:
- Document hypothesis: "If we [change X], then [metric Y] will improve because [reason]"
- Define primary and guardrail metrics
- Calculate required sample size BEFORE starting
- Wait for statistical significance (95% confidence minimum)
- Run for at least one full business cycle (1-2 weeks)
- Promote winners to new control

See [testing-methodology.md](references/testing-methodology.md) for statistical rigor and A/B vs. multivariate guidance.

### 9. Scale Wins
Apply insights across:
- Other landing pages
- Ad copy
- Email sequences
- Offline materials
- Affiliate programs

## Quick-Start Checklist

When optimizing any page:

1. [ ] What is the ONE action visitors should take?
2. [ ] Who are the visitors? What stage of buying journey?
3. [ ] What are their top 3-5 objections? (Don't guess—research)
4. [ ] What proof/counter-objections address each?
5. [ ] Is the value proposition crystal clear in 5 seconds?
6. [ ] Are there UX blockers? (speed, mobile, forms)
7. [ ] What persuasion assets are missing or hidden?

## Key Frameworks

- **O/CO Table**: Objection/Counter-Objection mapping. See [OBJECTIONS.md](references/OBJECTIONS.md)
- **Persuasion Assets**: Proof elements inventory. See [PERSUASION.md](references/PERSUASION.md)
- **Funnel Analysis**: Blocked arteries & missing links. See [funnel-analysis.md](references/funnel-analysis.md)
- **Bold vs. Meek**: Test big changes, not button colors. See [testing-methodology.md](references/testing-methodology.md)
- **ICE Prioritization**: Score ideas by Impact, Confidence, Ease

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- Copy competitors blindly
- Test button colors before understanding objections
- Assume you know why visitors leave
- Use "best practices" without validation
- Make changes based on HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)
- Optimize individual pages without funnel context
- Give up after one failed test
