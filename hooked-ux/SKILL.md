# Hook Model Framework

Framework for building habit-forming products. Based on a fundamental truth: habits are not created—they are built through successive cycles through the Hook.

## Core Principle

**The Hook Model** = a four-phase process that connects the user's problem to your solution frequently enough to form a habit.

```
Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment
    ↑                                      │
    └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Habit Zone:** Products enter the "habit zone" when used frequently enough and with enough perceived value. The goal is to move users from deliberate usage to automatic, habitual behavior.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When reviewing or creating product engagement mechanics, rate them 0-10 based on adherence to the principles below. A 10/10 means full alignment with all guidelines; lower scores indicate gaps to address. Always provide the current score and specific improvements needed to reach 10/10.

## The Four Phases

### 1. Trigger

The actuator of behavior. What prompts the user to take action?

**Two types of triggers:**

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **External** | Sensory stimuli in the environment | Push notification, email, button, ad, word of mouth |
| **Internal** | Internal cue, emotion, or routine | Boredom, loneliness, uncertainty, fear of missing out |

**The goal:** Move users from external triggers (you prompt them) to internal triggers (they prompt themselves).

**Mapping triggers to emotions:**

| Internal Trigger (Emotion) | Example Product |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Boredom | Instagram, TikTok, YouTube |
| Loneliness | Facebook, Messaging apps |
| Uncertainty/FOMO | Twitter, News apps |
| Confusion | Google, Stack Overflow |
| Stress/Anxiety | Games, Meditation apps |

See: [references/triggers.md](references/triggers.md) for detailed trigger design.

### 2. Action

The simplest behavior done in anticipation of a reward.

**Fogg Behavior Model:** `B = MAT`
- **M**otivation: User wants to do it
- **A**bility: User can easily do it
- **T**rigger: User is prompted to do it

**Six elements of simplicity (ability):**

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Time | How long does it take? | Infinite scroll vs. page load |
| Money | What's the financial cost? | Free tier vs. paywall |
| Physical effort | How much work? | Voice input vs. typing |
| Brain cycles | How much thinking? | Autocomplete vs. blank field |
| Social deviance | Is it socially acceptable? | Anonymous vs. public |
| Non-routine | How unfamiliar? | Familiar patterns vs. new UI |

**Key insight:** Increasing motivation is hard. Reducing friction is easier and often more effective.

**Action formula:**
```
Ease of action > User's motivation threshold
```

### 3. Variable Reward

The phase that keeps users coming back. The anticipation of reward (not the reward itself) creates dopamine.

**Three types of variable rewards:**

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Tribe** | Social rewards from others | Likes, comments, followers, status |
| **Hunt** | Search for resources/information | Scrolling feeds, search results, deals |
| **Self** | Personal accomplishment | Leveling up, completion, mastery |

**Critical:** Rewards must be **variable**. Predictable rewards lose power. The slot machine effect: uncertainty is addictive.

**Autonomy:** Users must feel in control. Forced engagement backfires.

See: [references/rewards.md](references/rewards.md) for reward design patterns.

### 4. Investment

The phase that increases the likelihood of another pass through the Hook.

**Principle:** Users value what they put effort into (IKEA effect). Investment creates switching costs.

**Types of investment:**

| Investment | Example | Switching Cost |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Data** | Preferences, history, uploads | Loss of personalization |
| **Content** | Posts, playlists, documents | Loss of created work |
| **Reputation** | Reviews, ratings, followers | Loss of social proof |
| **Skill** | Learning the interface | Learning curve for alternatives |
| **Social** | Connections, groups | Losing relationships |

**Investment loads the next trigger:**
- Creating content → Notification when someone responds
- Following users → Feed updates
- Setting preferences → Personalized recommendations

## The Habit Zone

Two axes determine if a product can become a habit:

| | Low Frequency | High Frequency |
|--|---------------|----------------|
| **High Perceived Value** | Viable product (needs ads/marketing) | **HABIT ZONE** |
| **Low Perceived Value** | Failure | Failure |

**Questions:**
- How often do users need to engage? (Daily, weekly, monthly?)
- What's the perceived value of each engagement?
- Is frequency high enough to form automatic behavior?

## Habit Testing

The 5% rule: A product has formed a habit when at least 5% of users show unprompted, habitual usage.

**Three questions for habit testing:**

1. **Who are the habitual users?**
   - Which users engage most frequently?
   - What do they have in common?

2. **What are they doing?**
   - What's the "Habit Path" (common sequence of actions)?
   - What differentiates power users from casual users?

3. **Why are they doing it?**
   - What internal trigger drives the behavior?
   - What emotion precedes usage?

See: [references/habit-testing.md](references/habit-testing.md) for testing methodology.

## The Manipulation Matrix

Framework for evaluating the ethics of habit-forming products.

|  | **Maker Uses Product** | **Maker Doesn't Use** |
|--|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Materially Improves User's Life** | **Facilitator** ✓ | **Peddler** ⚠️ |
| **Doesn't Improve Life** | **Entertainer** | **Dealer** ✗ |

**Questions to ask:**
1. Would I use this product myself?
2. Does it genuinely help users achieve their goals?
3. Am I exploiting vulnerabilities or serving needs?

### When NOT to Use the Hook Model

The Hook Model is inappropriate when:
- Your product doesn't genuinely improve lives
- You're targeting vulnerable populations (children, addiction-prone users)
- Business model depends on user regret
- Engagement conflicts with user wellbeing

See [ethical-boundaries.md](references/ethical-boundaries.md) for comprehensive ethics guidance.

### Regulatory Context

Be aware of emerging regulations around:
- **Children's apps:** COPPA, GDPR-K restrictions
- **Dark patterns:** FTC enforcement increasing
- **Notification practices:** Some jurisdictions regulating "addictive" features
- **Loot boxes:** Gaming regulations expanding

## Onboarding Audit Checklist

Optimizing onboarding for habit formation:

### First Trigger
- [ ] Is the first action obvious and easy?
- [ ] Is the value proposition clear before asking for investment?
- [ ] Are we using the right external trigger for this user?

### First Action
- [ ] Can the user complete the core action in under 60 seconds?
- [ ] Have we removed all unnecessary friction?
- [ ] Is the UI familiar (not requiring new learning)?

### First Reward
- [ ] Does the user get immediate feedback?
- [ ] Is there a variable element (surprise, delight)?
- [ ] Does the reward connect to an internal trigger?

### First Investment
- [ ] Do we ask for investment after reward (not before)?
- [ ] Is the investment small but meaningful?
- [ ] Does the investment load the next trigger?

### Loop Completion
- [ ] Is there a clear path back to the trigger?
- [ ] Do we send external triggers at appropriate times?
- [ ] Are we measuring progression through the Hook?

## Quick Diagnostic

Audit any product feature:

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| What's the internal trigger? | Users need reminders to use it | Research user emotions |
| Is the action dead simple? | Users start but don't complete | Remove friction |
| Is the reward variable? | Users get bored | Add unpredictability |
| Does investment load next trigger? | Users don't return | Connect investment to triggers |

## Warning Signs

Your habit loop is broken if:

- Users need constant external triggers (they're not forming habits)
- Engagement drops after novelty wears off (weak reward)
- Users don't increase usage over time (no investment)
- High churn despite initial engagement (wrong internal trigger)
- Users describe product as "useful but forgettable"
