# Product Applications of B=MAP

Applying the Fogg Behavior Model to specific product categories. Each section maps B=MAP to the unique retention challenges of that product type.

## SaaS Onboarding

### The SaaS Motivation Timeline

SaaS products face a predictable motivation pattern:
- **Signup:** High motivation (they chose to try it)
- **First session:** Moderate (exploratory, still hopeful)
- **Day 3-7:** Dropping (reality of switching costs, learning curve)
- **Day 14:** Trough (if habit hasn't formed, user forgets the product)
- **Day 30:** Decision point (free trial end, habit or churn)

### B=MAP for SaaS Key Behaviors

| Behavior | Motivation | Ability Bottleneck | Prompt Strategy |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Complete signup** | High | Time, mental effort | Immediate — on landing page |
| **First core action** | High but fragile | Mental effort (what do I do?) | In-app guided action |
| **Day-2 return** | Moderate | Non-routine (not habitual yet) | Event-based email ("Your project is ready") |
| **Invite teammates** | Low-moderate | Social deviance (is this tool good enough to recommend?) | After user experiences value, not before |
| **Daily usage** | Low (must survive trough) | Time, mental effort | Anchor-based (after standup, open dashboard) |
| **Feature adoption** | Low (satisfied with basics) | Mental effort, non-routine | Problem-based (show feature when user hits the problem) |
| **Upgrade to paid** | Requires high motivation | Money | After value proven, with loss aversion (data, customization) |

### SaaS Onboarding Recipe

```
1. Reduce signup to one click (SSO) — maximize Ability
2. Deliver first value in < 60 seconds — beat the motivation clock
3. Create one Tiny Habit — anchor to existing workflow
4. Send event-based prompts for Day 2-7 — don't spam
5. By Day 14, user should have a habit or you've lost them
```

### SaaS Activation Metrics Through B=MAP

| Metric | B=MAP Interpretation |
|--------|---------------------|
| Signup → First Action | Ability problem: is the first action easy enough? |
| First Action → Aha Moment | Prompt problem: does the user know what to do next? |
| Aha Moment → Day-7 Return | Ability + Prompt: is the behavior easy and prompted? |
| Day-7 → Day-30 | Habit: is a tiny behavior wired with an anchor? |

## Mobile Apps

### Mobile-Specific Ability Factors

Mobile context changes the Ability Chain:
- **Time:** Users have seconds, not minutes. Micro-sessions dominate.
- **Physical effort:** Thumb-only interaction. Touch targets must be 44pt+.
- **Mental effort:** Distracted context (commuting, waiting). Zero cognitive load.
- **Non-routine:** App must earn a home screen slot (and survive the "delete unused apps" purge).

### Mobile B=MAP Strategies

| Strategy | What It Does | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Widget** | Creates context prompt on home screen | Fitness app shows today's progress on widget |
| **Quick actions** | Reduces time and physical effort | 3D Touch / long press for common actions |
| **Smart notifications** | Action prompts at the right moment | "Your commute takes 25 min today" (maps app, event-based) |
| **Offline-first** | Removes ability barrier (connectivity) | Note-taking app works offline, syncs later |
| **Biometric login** | Eliminates time + mental effort of passwords | FaceID / TouchID opens directly to content |

### Mobile Retention Through B=MAP

**Day 1:** First session must deliver value before asking for anything. No "create account" before value. No permissions before context.

**Day 3:** Send one high-value notification tied to a real event. Not "come back!" but "your friend shared something with you."

**Day 7:** If user hasn't formed a micro-habit, they'll likely churn. Design for one tiny behavior that happens daily.

**Day 30:** The app must have earned its home screen slot. Value must be visible without opening the app (widget, badge, notification content).

## E-Commerce

### E-Commerce Behavior Types

E-commerce combines multiple behavior types:
- **One-time:** First purchase (high motivation, moderate ability)
- **Repeat:** Return purchase (moderate motivation, high ability if first experience was good)
- **Habitual:** Regular browsing/purchasing (low motivation needed, high ability)

### B=MAP for E-Commerce

| Behavior | Key Bottleneck | B=MAP Fix |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Browse → Cart** | Mental effort (decision paralysis) | Curation, recommendations, "customers also bought" |
| **Cart → Checkout** | Time, money, mental effort | One-click checkout, saved payment, clear pricing |
| **First → Second Purchase** | Motivation (no immediate need) | Event-based prompt when relevant (restock, new arrival) |
| **Browse without buying** | Prompt timing (not ready to buy) | Wishlist (investment), price drop alerts (future prompt) |
| **Abandoned cart** | Motivation dropped or ability barrier hit | Diagnose which: if ability, simplify. If motivation, wait and prompt later |

### E-Commerce Retention Recipe

1. **First purchase:** Maximize ability (guest checkout, Apple Pay, minimal fields)
2. **Post-purchase:** Create investment (account creation after purchase, order tracking)
3. **Return visit:** Event-based prompts (back in stock, price drop, new in your category)
4. **Habitual browsing:** Context prompts (email digest, app badge for new arrivals)

## Health & Fitness

### Health Motivation Waves

Health products face the most extreme motivation waves:
- **January/New Year:** Massive spike (resolutions)
- **Week 2:** Crash (reality of effort)
- **Spring:** Moderate recovery (summer body motivation)
- **Rest of year:** Low-moderate baseline

### B=MAP for Health Behaviors

| Behavior | Challenge | B=MAP Strategy |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Daily exercise** | Motivation crashes after week 1 | Tiny Habit: "After I pour coffee, I do 2 pushups" — grow from there |
| **Meal logging** | Mental effort (what did I eat?) | Photo-based logging, barcode scan, recent meals |
| **Medication tracking** | Non-routine (easy to forget) | Anchor to existing routine + alarm prompt |
| **Weekly check-in** | Motivation drops without visible progress | Show progress visualization, body measurements graph |

### The Health Product Tiny Habits Template

```
After I [morning anchor], I will [30-second health action], then I [celebrate progress].
```

**Examples:**
- After I brush my teeth, I will do 2 stretches, then I check my streak
- After I sit at my desk, I will log my water, then I see my hydration score
- After dinner, I will open the meal log and snap a photo, then I see my day's nutrition

### Health Retention Metrics

| Metric | B=MAP Diagnosis |
|--------|----------------|
| Day-1 → Day-3 retention | Was the first workout/log easy enough? (Ability) |
| Day-7 retention | Did a tiny habit anchor form? (Prompt + Ability) |
| Day-30 retention | Is the behavior surviving the motivation trough? (Ability-first design) |
| 6-month retention | Is the behavior automatic? (Habit formed, internal prompts) |

## Education / Learning

### The Learning Motivation Challenge

Learning products face a unique problem: the behavior (studying) is often effortful, and the reward (knowledge) is delayed. This means ability must be very high and prompts must be very well-timed.

### B=MAP for Learning Behaviors

| Behavior | Key Challenge | B=MAP Strategy |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Start a lesson** | Mental effort (blank-page resistance) | One-tap start, auto-resume where you left off |
| **Complete a lesson** | Time (lessons too long for motivation) | Micro-lessons (< 5 min), clear progress bar |
| **Daily practice** | Non-routine (not habitual yet) | Streak system + anchor to commute or morning routine |
| **Review material** | Motivation (review is boring) | Spaced repetition with variable difficulty (curiosity) |

### The Duolingo Formula (Through B=MAP)

Duolingo is the gold standard for learning retention because it systematically optimizes B=MAP:

- **Motivation:** Streak fear (anticipation), league competition (belonging), XP celebration (sensation)
- **Ability:** 5-minute lessons, tap-to-answer, no typing required for beginners
- **Prompt:** Daily notification ("Don't lose your streak!"), streak widget, perfectly timed

**Critical insight:** Duolingo's streak is not primarily a motivation tool — it's a prompt tool. "Don't break your streak" is an internal Person Prompt that fires every day at the same time.

## Cross-Category Patterns

### Universal B=MAP Retention Sequence

Regardless of product category, this sequence applies:

| Phase | Focus | B=MAP Priority |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Activation** (Day 0-1) | First value | Ability (make first action trivial) |
| **Engagement** (Day 1-7) | Repeat usage | Prompt (event-based, anchor-based) |
| **Habit formation** (Day 7-30) | Survive the trough | Ability + Prompt (tiny habits, reduce friction) |
| **Retention** (Day 30+) | Automatic behavior | Reduce prompts, deepen investment |
| **Expansion** (Day 60+) | Feature adoption, upgrade | Motivation + Prompt (new features at the right moment) |

### Universal Ability Wins

These ability improvements work across all product categories:

| Improvement | Impact | Why It's Universal |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| SSO / passwordless login | Removes time + mental effort from every session | Every product requires authentication |
| Smart defaults | Removes mental effort from setup | Every product requires configuration |
| Templates | Removes blank-page resistance | Every product requires content creation |
| Auto-save | Removes fear of losing work | Every product involves data entry |
| Mobile optimization | Removes physical effort barrier | Every user has a phone |
| Progressive disclosure | Reduces mental effort for new users | Every product has complexity |
