# StoryBrand Messaging Framework

Framework for clarifying your message so customers will listen. Based on a fundamental truth: customers don't buy the best products—they buy the ones they can understand the fastest.

## Core Principle

**The customer is the hero, not your brand.** Your brand is the guide who helps the hero win. When you position yourself as the hero, you compete with your customer. When you position yourself as the guide, you serve them.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When reviewing or creating marketing copy or brand messaging, rate it 0-10 based on adherence to the principles below. A 10/10 means full alignment with all guidelines; lower scores indicate gaps to address. Always provide the current score and specific improvements needed to reach 10/10.

## The SB7 Framework

Every compelling story follows the same pattern. Use this structure for all messaging:

### 1. Character (The Hero)

The customer wants something. Be specific about what they want.

**Audience Segmentation:**
Different segments may have different primary desires. Create separate messaging for:
- Different roles (CEO vs. Manager vs. Individual contributor)
- Different stages (Startup vs. Scale-up vs. Enterprise)
- Different pain intensity (Aware vs. Urgent)

**Rules:**
- Open a story gap (desire creates tension)
- Focus on ONE desire per message (not a list)
- The desire should be related to survival (physical, financial, relational, spiritual)
- Aspirational identity is powerful ("become the leader everyone respects")

**Examples:**
- "You want a beautiful smile" (not "our dentistry is excellent")
- "You want to retire early" (not "we offer comprehensive financial planning")

### 2. Problem

The hero faces a problem that stands in their way.

**Three levels of problems:**

| Level | Definition | Example (financial advisor) |
|-------|------------|----------------------------|
| **External** | The tangible, surface problem | "My investments are scattered" |
| **Internal** | How it makes them feel | "I feel confused and overwhelmed" |
| **Philosophical** | Why it's wrong/unjust | "People shouldn't have to be experts to retire well" |

**The villain:** Personify the problem. A villain gives the problem a face.

- Bad villain: "complexity" (abstract)
- Good villain: "Wall Street jargon designed to confuse you"

**Critical:** Most brands only address external problems. Internal problems drive purchasing decisions.

### 3. Guide (Your Brand)

Enter the guide—a character who has empathy AND authority.

**Two qualities every guide needs:**

| Quality | What it means | How to demonstrate |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Empathy** | "I understand your pain" | Use "we understand" language, describe their frustration accurately |
| **Authority** | "I can solve this" | Testimonials, logos, statistics, awards, experience |

**Common mistakes:**
- Too much authority, no empathy = arrogant
- Too much empathy, no authority = weak
- Telling your origin story (hero behavior)

### 4. Plan

The guide gives the hero a plan. Plans create clarity and reduce fear.

**Two types of plans:**

**Process Plan** (3-4 steps to work with you):
1. Schedule a call
2. Get a custom plan
3. Start seeing results

**Agreement Plan** (commitments you make to remove fear):
- "We'll never pressure you to buy"
- "100% satisfaction guaranteed"
- "Cancel anytime"

**Rules:**
- Limit to 3-4 steps maximum
- Use action verbs
- Number the steps
- Give each step a simple name

### 5. Call to Action

The guide calls the hero to action. If you don't ask, they won't act.

**Two types of CTAs:**

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Direct CTA** | The primary action you want | "Buy Now", "Schedule a Call", "Get Started" |
| **Transitional CTA** | Lower commitment for those not ready | "Download Free Guide", "Watch Demo", "Take the Quiz" |

**Rules for Direct CTA:**
- Use a button (not a text link)
- Make it stand out visually (different color)
- Repeat it multiple times on the page
- Use action language ("Get" not "Submit")

### 6. Success (Stakes)

Paint a picture of what life looks like after they work with you.

**Three elements of success:**
- **Status**: How will they be perceived? ("Become the go-to expert")
- **Completeness**: What gap will be closed? ("Finally have financial peace")
- **Self-realization**: Who will they become? ("Be the leader you were meant to be")

**Show the transformation:**
- Before/after comparisons
- Customer success stories
- Specific outcomes (numbers, results)

### 7. Failure (Stakes)

Paint a picture of what happens if they don't act.

**Purpose:** Create stakes. Without stakes, there's no story.

**Rules:**
- Don't overdo fear (just a taste)
- Be honest about consequences
- Focus on opportunity cost, not punishment
- Use "what if you don't" framing

**Examples:**
- "How long will you wait before getting this handled?"
- "Don't let another year go by feeling overwhelmed"

## The One-Liner

A single sentence that clearly explains what you do. Use it everywhere.

**Formula:**
```
[Problem] + [Solution] + [Result]
```

**Structure:**
"We help [CHARACTER] who struggle with [PROBLEM] to [SOLUTION] so they can [RESULT]."

**Examples:**
- "We help busy parents who struggle to cook healthy meals get fresh ingredients delivered weekly so they can feed their family nutritious food without the stress."
- "We help small business owners who feel overwhelmed by marketing create a clear message so they can grow their revenue."

**Test:** Can someone repeat it after hearing it once?

## Tone and Voice Guidelines

Your brand voice should be consistent across all channels while adapting to context:

**Guide qualities to convey:**
- Empathy: "We understand..."
- Authority: "In our experience..."
- Confidence: "Here's what works..."
- Helpfulness: "Let us show you..."

**Avoid:**
- Hero language: "We're the best at..."
- Jargon: Use customer's words
- Condescension: Respect their intelligence
- Weakness: Be confident, not tentative

## Common Messaging Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Being the hero | Competes with customer | Position as guide |
| Multiple messages | Confuses people | One clear message per asset |
| Clever > clear | People don't decode messaging | Choose clarity always |
| Feature-focused | Customers care about transformation | Lead with outcomes |
| No clear CTA | No direction = no action | Ask for the sale |
| No stakes | No urgency = no motivation | Paint failure picture |
| Starting with "We" | Self-focused | Start with customer's problem |

## Quick Diagnostic

Ask these questions about any marketing asset:

1. [ ] Can a caveman understand what you offer in 5 seconds?
2. [ ] Is the customer clearly the hero?
3. [ ] Have you identified internal problem, not just external?
4. [ ] Do you demonstrate empathy AND authority?
5. [ ] Is there a clear 3-step plan?
6. [ ] Is there one obvious CTA?
7. [ ] Do you show success AND failure stakes?

If any answer is "no"—that's your problem.
