# Top-Design: Award-Winning Digital Experiences

Create websites and applications at the level of world-class digital agencies. This skill embodies the craft of studios that consistently win FWA, Awwwards, CSS Design Awards, and Webby Awards.

## Core Philosophy

**The agencies you're emulating share these traits:**
- Every pixel is intentional — nothing default, nothing accidental
- Typography IS the design — not decoration, but architecture
- Motion creates emotion — animation serves narrative, not novelty
- White space is a weapon — tension through restraint
- Performance is non-negotiable — 60fps or nothing

**What separates 10/10 from 8/10:**
- 8/10: Good typography, nice colors, smooth animations
- 10/10: Typography that makes you gasp, colors that feel invented, animations that tell stories

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** When reviewing or creating digital experiences, rate them 0-10 using the rubric below. A 10/10 means the design would be featured on Awwwards. Always provide the current score and specific improvements needed to reach 10/10.

### Scoring Rubric

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **0-2** | Amateur | Default fonts, no hierarchy, generic layout, template feel |
| **3-4** | Basic | Decent typography, some hierarchy, but forgettable |
| **5-6** | Competent | Good fundamentals, clean execution, but lacks soul |
| **7-8** | Professional | Strong typography, intentional motion, clear POV |
| **9** | Exceptional | Signature moments, memorable details, near-flawless craft |
| **10** | World-class | Would win Awwwards SOTD, defines new standards |

### Category Scoring (Each 0-10)

**TYPOGRAPHY (Weight: 25%)**
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-3 | System fonts, uniform scale, default tracking |
| 4-6 | Premium fonts, some scale contrast, basic hierarchy |
| 7-8 | Dramatic scale contrast (10:1+), perfect tracking, optical alignment |
| 9-10 | Typography IS the design—gasping moments, custom/variable fonts, type as architecture |

**VISUAL COMPOSITION (Weight: 25%)**
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-3 | Centered everything, equal spacing, rigid grid, no tension |
| 4-6 | Some asymmetry, decent spacing rhythm, basic depth |
| 7-8 | Intentional grid breaks, layered elements, strong negative space |
| 9-10 | Magnetic compositions, unexpected scale shifts, elements that breathe and surprise |

**MOTION & INTERACTION (Weight: 20%)**
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-3 | No animation or default/linear motion |
| 4-6 | Basic transitions, some scroll effects |
| 7-8 | Custom easing, orchestrated reveals, purposeful parallax |
| 9-10 | Motion that tells stories, perfectly timed choreography, scroll feels invented |

**COLOR & ATMOSPHERE (Weight: 15%)**
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-3 | Random colors, pure black/white, no mood |
| 4-6 | Cohesive palette, some atmosphere |
| 7-8 | Colors feel owned, contextual shifts, intentional contrast |
| 9-10 | Colors feel invented for this project, atmosphere you can feel |

**DETAILS & CRAFT (Weight: 15%)**
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-3 | Default cursors, no hover states, generic everything |
| 4-6 | Basic hover states, some custom elements |
| 7-8 | Custom cursor, magnetic buttons, branded selection colors |
| 9-10 | Every micro-detail considered—focus states, loading, empty states, scroll indicators |

### Quick Score Formula
```
Total = (Typography × 0.25) + (Composition × 0.25) + (Motion × 0.20) + (Color × 0.15) + (Details × 0.15)
```

## The 10/10 Difference: What Makes Design Exceptional

### Typography That Commands Attention

**The Gasping Moment Test:** If someone scrolls past your hero and doesn't pause, your typography isn't working.

**Scale Contrast That Shocks:**
```
WEAK:    48px headline / 16px body (3:1 ratio)
GOOD:    96px headline / 16px body (6:1 ratio)
GREAT:   180px headline / 14px body (13:1 ratio)
10/10:   Viewport-filling type that makes body text feel intimate
```

**Font Selection Hierarchy:**
```
DISPLAY/HERO: The statement maker
├── Custom/Variable fonts (preferred)
├── Foundry fonts: Pangram Pangram, Dinamo, Grilli Type, Klim, Commercial Type
├── Premium Google: Space Grotesk, Instrument Serif, Fraunces
└── NEVER: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui (these are for apps, not experiences)

BODY: The workhorse
├── Match personality to display font
├── Legibility at 16-18px minimum
└── Consider: Söhne, GT America, Suisse, Neue Montreal
```

**Typography Principles:**
- Massive scale contrast: 200px hero + 14px body
- Negative tracking on large type (-0.02em to -0.05em)
- Generous line-height for body (1.5-1.7)
- Tight line-height for display (0.85-1.0)
- Optical alignment over mathematical alignment
- Text that breaks beautifully—control every line break on headlines
- Variable fonts for weight animation on hover

**The Typography Stare Test:** Blur your eyes. Does the type hierarchy still read? If everything looks the same importance when blurred, you've failed.

### Composition That Creates Tension

**The Grid Paradox:** Master the grid so you can break it with intention. Every violation should feel deliberate, not accidental.

**White Space as a Weapon:**
- Amateur: Fills every gap with content
- Pro: Uses padding liberally
- 10/10: White space creates tension, makes you lean in, controls pacing

**Asymmetric Balance:**
```css
/* Don't center—create visual tension */
.hero-title {
  /* Offset from center, aligned to grid but not centered */
  margin-left: 8.33%; /* One column offset */
  max-width: 83.33%; /* 10 of 12 columns */
}

/* Let images bleed and overlap */
.hero-image {
  margin-right: -5vw; /* Extend beyond container */
  width: calc(100% + 5vw);
}
```

**Unexpected Scale Shifts:**
- Full-viewport hero → intimate text section → massive single word → dense grid
- The rhythm of density and breathing room creates a reading experience

**The Screenshot Test:** Would someone screenshot this section and share it? If not, you're missing signature moments.

### Motion That Creates Emotion

**The Three Laws of Elite Motion:**
1. **Purpose Over Decoration**: Every animation answers "Why does this move?"
2. **Custom Curves, Never Linear**: `ease` and `linear` are banned
3. **Orchestration Over Isolation**: Elements animate in relationship, not independently

**Custom Easing (Agency Standards):**
```css
:root {
  /* These are your only easings */
  --ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
  --ease-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1);
  --ease-in-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.87, 0, 0.13, 1);

  /* NEVER use: ease, ease-in, ease-out, linear */
}
```

**Page Load Choreography:**
```
Frame 0-200ms:   Background/structure fades in
Frame 200-600ms: Hero title words slide up (staggered 80ms)
Frame 400-800ms: Hero subtitle fades up
Frame 600-900ms: Navigation items cascade down
Frame 800-1200ms: Supporting elements reveal
```

**Scroll-Triggered Sequences:**
- Elements reveal as they enter viewport (not all at once)
- Parallax used sparingly and only on non-essential elements
- Pinned sections for storytelling moments
- Horizontal scroll for galleries (with clear affordance)

**The Smooth Scroll Standard:** Default browser scroll is unacceptable. Use Lenis or Locomotive Scroll.

### Color That Feels Invented

**Approach Types:**
```
MONOCHROMATIC TENSION
├── 95% one dominant color/neutral
├── 5% accent that POPS
└── Example: Locomotive (cream + black + orange spark)

BOLD SIGNATURE
├── Own a color combination
├── Make it unmistakable
└── Example: Studio Freight (black + cream + rust)

CONTEXTUAL SHIFTING
├── Color responds to content
├── Sections have distinct palettes
└── Example: AREA 17 (adapts to each client case study)
```

**Technical Implementation:**
```css
:root {
  /* Never just 'black' or 'white' */
  --color-dark: #0a0a0a;      /* Slightly warm black */
  --color-light: #fafaf9;     /* Slightly warm white */
  --color-accent: #ff4d00;    /* A color you OWN */

  /* Functional hierarchy */
  --color-text-primary: var(--color-dark);
  --color-text-secondary: rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.6);
  --color-text-tertiary: rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.4);
  --color-surface: var(--color-light);
  --color-border: rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.1);
}
```

**The Squint Test:** Squint at your design. Do the important things stand out through contrast alone?

### Details That Signal Craft

**The Details Checklist (All Required for 10/10):**

```
CURSOR
☐ Custom cursor that reflects brand personality
☐ Cursor changes on interactive elements
☐ Magnetic effect on buttons (subtle)

SELECTION
☐ Custom ::selection color that's on-brand
☐ Selection works well on all backgrounds

HOVER STATES
☐ Every link has a considered hover state
☐ Images have scale or overlay treatment
☐ Cards transform meaningfully

FOCUS STATES
☐ Focus states are visible and beautiful
☐ Focus indicators match brand aesthetic
☐ Tab order is logical

LOADING STATES
☐ Custom skeleton/loading animation
☐ Progress indicators are designed
☐ First contentful paint is instant

EMPTY STATES
☐ Empty states are designed, not default
☐ Error states are helpful and branded
☐ 404 pages are memorable

MICRO-TYPOGRAPHY
☐ Smart quotes (" " not " ")
☐ Proper apostrophes (' not ')
☐ En/em dashes where appropriate
☐ No orphans on headlines
☐ text-wrap: balance on key text
```

### The Signature Moment

Every 10/10 project has at least one moment that makes people stop and share. Design this first.

**Types of Signature Moments:**
- A hero animation that's never been seen before
- Typography so bold it becomes the visual
- An interaction that delights unexpectedly
- A scroll sequence that tells a story
- A transition that feels like magic

**Questions to Identify Your Signature:**
1. What will people screenshot?
2. What will they describe to colleagues?
3. What will they try to reverse-engineer?
4. What makes this unmistakably THIS project?

---

## Design Process

### 1. Concept First, Code Second

Before any code, define:
```
BRAND ESSENCE: What single word captures the soul?
VISUAL TENSION: What opposing forces create interest?
SIGNATURE MOMENT: What will people screenshot and share?
TECHNICAL AMBITION: What pushes the browser's limits?
```

### 2. Design the Signature Moment First

Don't start with the header. Start with the thing that defines the experience. The header can be solved later.

### 3. Typography Sets Everything

Choose your display typeface first. Let it dictate:
- The color palette mood
- The animation style
- The spacing rhythm
- The overall personality

### 4. Motion Is Not Polish

Prototype animations early. Motion design happens alongside visual design, not after.

### 5. Ship With Restraint

3 things perfect beats 10 things mediocre. Cut ruthlessly.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Start with the signature moment** — design the thing that defines the experience first
2. **Conceptualize desktop-first, build mobile-first** — dream big, implement progressively
3. **Prototype animations early** — motion is not a polish step, it's core to the design
4. **Test on real devices** — simulators lie about performance and feel
5. **Ship with restraint** — 3 things perfect beats 10 things mediocre
6. **Sweat the micro-details** — craft lives in the 1% others skip
7. **Design the states** — hover, focus, loading, empty, error all matter
8. **Own your constraints** — every limitation is a design opportunity
